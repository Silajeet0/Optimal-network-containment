**NetGuard AI** is a research-oriented Reinforcement Learning framework designed to optimize the containment of misinformation (rumors) on complex social networks.

By simulating SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) dynamics on **modular scale-free networks**, this project benchmarks traditional heuristics against AI agents. Our research uncovered the **"Hub Fallacy"**—demonstrating that while degree-based heuristics target influencers, our **GraphSAGE Agent** achieves superior containment by identifying and blocking "bridge" nodes (High Betweenness Centrality) that connect isolated communities.

## 📥 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rumor-Spread-Inoculation-Agent/NetGuard_AI?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-usage-guide
cd NetGuard-AI
```

### 2. Set up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🖥️ Usage Guide
1. Training the Agents

To train the agents from scratch using the simulation environment:

### Train the GraphSAGE (GNN) Agent:

```bash
python train_gnn.py
```
This will save the model weights to the "models" directory.

### Train the DQN Agent:

```bash
python train_dqn.py
```
This will save the model weights to the "models" directory.

2. Running the Interactive Simulator (GUI)

To watch the agents battle the virus in real-time on a visualized graph:
```bash
python gui.py
```
Controls: Use the menu to select the Agent (GNN, DQN, MCTS, Heuristic) and click "Agent: Innoculate_step."

3. Evaluation & Plotting

To generate the reward curves and win-rate comparison plots:
```bash
python evaluate.py
```

### 📊 Results: The "Hub Fallacy"

Our experiments revealed that Popularity does not equal Virality.

In modular communities, high-degree nodes ("Hubs") are often trapped inside their own clusters. The GraphSAGE Agent outperformed standard heuristics by learning to target Betweenness Centrality—the "Bridges" that allow the virus to jump between clusters.
